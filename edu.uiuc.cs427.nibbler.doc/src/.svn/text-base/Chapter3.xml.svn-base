		  Currently CS427 Team Nibbler has no future plans for this project.  With additional testing and code cleanup 
		  there is a possibility that it could be used within Photran.  For this project to actually be used with Photran
		  several design decisions would most likely need to be analyzed to see if the choices that were made by Team
		  Nibbler will actually fit within the model that is provided within Photran.  The primary issues that would need to be
		  analyzed are

		          Use of Build Configurations to support building FRUIT application

		          Better integration of FRUIT distribution into Photran
		      </listitem>
		      <listitem>
		          Decision to parse fruit output.  Integration with the FRUIT project would potentially
		          allow a more stable output format.
